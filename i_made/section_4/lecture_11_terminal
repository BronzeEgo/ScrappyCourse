#Using XPath with Scrapy

#XPath is a language for selecting nodes from an XML document (works with html as well)

#I want to use the shell to use XPath selectors on a mock HTML document
scrapy shell

#I'll need to import selector
from scrapy.selector import Selector

#I then do something that makes little sense to me, but it allows me to
#take HTML and use Selector on it.
#I first put html_doc = ''' at the top of the html document (foo.html)
#I then put ''' at the bottom of foo.html
#I think this allows me to copy the section I want to mess with directly into the terminal?!
#I then paste it into the terminal using right-click + enter
#The output is:
html_doc = '''
... <html>
...
... <head>
...   <title>Title of the page</title>
... </head>
...
... <body>
...   <h1>H1 Tag</h1>
...   <h2>H2 Tag with <a href="#">link</a></h2>
...   <p>First Paragraph</p>
...   <p>Second Paragraph</p>
... </body>
...
... </html>
... '''
#END output

#I then assign Selector and the document to a variable for use...
sel = Selector(text=html_doc)
(no output)

#To confirm it is good, I type:
sel.extract()
#and get
'<html>\n\n<head>\n  <title>Title of the page</title>\n</head>\n\n<body>\n  <h1>H1 Tag</h1>\n  <h2>H2 Tag with <a href="#">link</a></h2>\n  <p>First Paragraph</p>\n  <p>Second Paragraph</p>\n</body>\n\n</html>'

VSCode terminal is acting weird. The first terminal (from the previous section) says
'scrapy' and gives the nice 
[1]input
[1]output formatting

Anytime I try to open scrapy in a new terminal, it defaults to 'Python', which does not give the nive formatting.
This is actually what I am requesting since I am using 'Python: Create Terminal'
What I think I want is 'scrapy: Create Terminal'
I need to figure out how to add that...

Back to the video...He is basically covering what he already covered about XPath...
If I want to go through the whole html tree, I start with '/' rather than '//' and go through each item that way.
It may be necessary.
I'm not going to take any more notes for now. I will revisit the short video if necessary...
